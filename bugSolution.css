The solution involves careful review of the CSS code to identify incorrect property values or unsupported properties. Using a CSS validator can help. Here is the corrected code:

/* bugSolution.css */
.my-element {
  font-size: 10px; /* Correct: removed extra 'x' */
  /* Other valid CSS properties */
}

/* If an unknown property was used, remove it or replace it with a valid one. */
